The excel file contains the results that were compiled from output files in the raw_data directory.

From that, I exported a tab-separated file from sheet 2 and sheet 3. I added a column that contains 5000, since 5000 cyles/sec is our target, so that shows up on the plot.

Gnuplot expects data to be plotted in columns. It plots one column against another. So, the data had to be recast in that format.

The program plotdata.gnuplot contains the plotting code. It generates postscript files. Those postscript files were converted to JPEG via Preview program on a Mac. The JPEG files were manually cropped to remove whitespace and then imported in the annual presentation.
