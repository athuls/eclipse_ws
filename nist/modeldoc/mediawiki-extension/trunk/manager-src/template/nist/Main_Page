<h3>Cyber-Enabled Wireless Monitoring Systems <br />for the Protection of Deteriorating National Infrastructure Systems</h3>

The overall objective of the project is to design, construct and deploy cyber-enabled wireless structural monitoring systems on large-scale national infrastructure systems. A particular emphasis will be placed on highway bridges given their importance in supporting national commerce and their dire structural condition (e.g., of the 600,000 highway bridges in the U.S., more than 25% are rated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete). The team will resolve long-standing technological bottlenecks that have hindered the development of automated structural health monitoring systems for bridges in the past (see right).

<b>Key Technical Bottlenecks:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Current monitoring system architectures support low sensor densities</li>
  <li>System are over reliant on homogenous sensor sets</li>
  <li>Sensors only provide point measurements and do not directly sense damage</li>
  <li>Costs of wired monitoring systems are high</li>
  <li>Data inundation occurs when raw data is centralized to a single server</li>
  <li>Lack of automated data interrogation algorithms available for damage detection</li>
  <li>Absence of interaction between visual inspections and monitoring systems</li>
  <li>Difficulties in measuring the operational loads (e.g., trucks) common on bridges</li>

A global objective of the project is to develop a new class of multifunctional materials that are endowed with self-sensing functionality. Specifically, cement-based composites and polymeric coating systems capable of sensing strain, cracking and corrosion will be developed for bridge monitoring. Coupled with electrical impedance tomography (EIT), self-sensing materials will be developed to offer two-dimensional maps of their measurements. As a distributed sensor platform capable of direct measurement of damage and degradation, multifunctional materials represent a significant departure from homogenous point sensors common in monitoring systems today. Another principal objective is to adopt wireless communications within structural monitoring systems. Adoption of wireless communications substantially reduces the cost of systems; this promotes the adoption of greater sensor densities within a single system. Another important project objective is to resolve the challenges associated with the management and processing of the raw sensor data generated by a structural monitoring system. Specifically, cyberinfrastructure tools will be developed to support the automated interrogation of sensor data in order to provide bridge owners with actionable information for improved decision-making. To accelerate the attainment of these objectives, the team will collaborate with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to validate the cyber- enabled wireless monitoring system on operational bridge structures.
